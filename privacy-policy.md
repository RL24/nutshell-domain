What information does Nutshell obtain and how is it used?

### Day Ratings and Notes

Your data is stored locally on your device and in our cloud data store hosted by Google Firebase.

We obtain your email address when you login with Google but this is only ever used to verify and authenticate you. All data regarding your daily ratings and notes is backed up to our cloud data store against a unique ID generated for your user.

All daily ratings stored in our cloud data store are only ever used by us for analytics purposes, and all notes stored against days are encrypted per device and not stored in plain text.

Analytics
---------

Our application may collect some anonymized usage data that are essential for us to deliver our services, to understand your needs, and to improve our services. Such as app launches, taps, clicks, screen visits, or other information about how users interact with our app. These data are fully anonymized and aggregated and thus not linked to any particular user. To find bugs and maximize stability, we also collect crashes amd look at performance reports.

Device Permissions

We will ask for your separate permissions to send push notifications to you. If you change your mind re permissions granted, you will be able to revoke them at any time afterwards by changing settings on your Device.
